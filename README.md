* About task1 :Installed Ubuntu through VirtualBox. Wrote code to find the sum of numbers from 1 to N(100). Additonally executed assembly level program and verified the results .

* About task2 :
I started by writing a simple C program to add two numbers and saved the file as `add.c`. Afterward, I compiled it using `gcc add.c` and executed the program with `./a.out`. Additionally, I compiled it using `spike pk add.o` for further analysis.  
Next, I performed a RISC-V object dump for both `-O1` and `-Ofast` optimization levels to examine the generated assembly code.
Using the Spike RISC-V simulator with the command `spike -d pk add.o`, I analyzed the register values and observed how different accumulators stored the results.
Then,  took snapshots of the outputs and uploaded them to my GitHub repository.
